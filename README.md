# nba-score-counter

This is a project that I did for the Grow With Google Challenge Scholarship: Android Basics on Udacity.
  
It has all the concepts that I learned from the intermediate lessons of the course including:
- Creating more complex layouts
- Setting up buttons and connecting them to Java code
- Making a Spinner to choose from various selections and change the behavior of the code or update views accordingly
